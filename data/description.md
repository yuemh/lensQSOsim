lowzlensedqso.fits: the mock catalog for quasars at z_qso<5. Corresponding to one all-sky area.

highzlensedqso.fits: the mock catalog for quasars at z_qso>5. Corresponding to 20 all-sky area.

qsospec.fits: the simulated (un-magnified) spectrum of the mock quasars.

## Columns in the catalog

qra, qdec: the coordinate of the background quasar

absMag: the absolute magnitude at rest-frame 1450 \AA of the quasar (not magnified).
