This folder contains the mock catalogs of lensed quasars. There are two files:

- lowzlensqso_upload.fits: the low-redshift (z<5) sample, which corresponds to one all-sky area.
- highzlensqso_upload.fits: the high-redshift (z>5) sample, which corresponds to 20 all-sky area.

See Yue et al. in prep. for the info of the columns.
